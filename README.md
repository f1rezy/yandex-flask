# yandex-flask

# Description

Website made as a project at the Yandex Academy Lyceum using Flask.

`The code has NOT been polished and is provided "as is". There are a lot of code that are redundant and there are tons of improvements that can be made.`

# Python version

I was using Python 3.11.3, but it should work on any newer version.
